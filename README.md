# KubeNotes

KubeNotes is a lightweight, containerized note-taking REST API designed for Kubernetes environments. This project demonstrates best practices in cloud-native deployments including:

- Kubernetes manifests for core resources  
- Helm chart packaging  
- Kustomize overlays for environment-specific configurations  
- GitHub Actions for CI/CD automation  
- ArgoCD for GitOps-based continuous delivery

## Features

- REST API to create, read, update, and delete notes  
- Configurable deployment with Helm and Kustomize  
- Environment overlays for dev, staging, and prod  
- GitOps-ready via ArgoCD Application manifest  
- Automated build and deploy pipeline with GitHub Actions

## Prerequisites

- Kubernetes cluster (e.g., Minikube, Kind, EKS, GKE)  
- `kubectl`, `helm`, `kustomize` CLI tools installed  
- ArgoCD installed on the cluster (optional for GitOps)  

---

## Deployment

### Using Kustomize (Recommended for environment overlays)

Deploy to the dev environment:

```bash
kubectl apply -k overlays/dev
Using Helm
Install the Helm chart:

bash
Copy
Edit
helm install kubenotes charts/kubenotes/ --namespace default
Update the values.yaml to customize deployment parameters.

GitOps Deployment via ArgoCD
Add your repository to ArgoCD and apply:

bash
Copy
Edit
kubectl apply -f argocd/application.yaml
ArgoCD will monitor and sync the app automatically.

Configuration Management
The manifests/ directory contains the base resource definitions including ConfigMap and Secret.

Use Kustomize overlays to adjust configurations per environment.

CI/CD Pipeline
Defined in .github/workflows/deploy.yaml

Builds Docker image, pushes to container registry, and triggers ArgoCD sync on pushes to the main branch.
